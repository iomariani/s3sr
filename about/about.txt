s3sr (Scripter)

- ABOUT

  Using a Custom Script (*.s3sr) this application will attempt to read the Game Resources
    and apply the Script specified attribute(s).

  After reading and modifying its attribute(s), the specified resource(s) will be exported to
    a default replacement package, in which will be replaced by the game once readen.

  -  Current Release: Alpha, for purpose of testing your own custom scripts.

    - S3RC

      Integration with s3rc to decrypt encryted DBPP packages.
      User will be prompted before doing so.


- PURPOSE

  With updates on OBJD/CASP structures made by the game developers, every default replacement package
    that carries those type of resources become unusable and might cause problems to your game
    when they have different structures.
  The purpose of this application is exactly to avoid such problem as it will extract from the origianl package.
  Whatever structure the resource is built in, however in case of such,
    the s3pi libraries that takes care of extracting the resources need to be updated as well.

  Since only those need to update, there's no need to remake all the work.
  That's where this application comes into place.

  DO NOT share the resulting package of a ran script.
  It breaks the exact purpose of this application.
  You should share the script for it instead.
